NAME
    HTML::FormatText::WithLinks::AndTables - Converts HTML to Text with
    tables intact

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::FormatText::WithLinks::AndTables;

        my $text = HTML::FormatText::WithLinks::AndTables->convert($html);

    Or optionally...

        my $conf = { # same as HTML::FormatText excepting below
            cellpadding   => 2,  # defaults to 1
            no_rowspacing => 1,  # bool, suppress vertical space between table rows
        };

        my $text = HTML::FormatText::WithLinks::AndTables->convert($html, $conf);

DESCRIPTION
    This module was inspired by HTML::FormatText::WithLinks which has proven
    to be a useful `lynx -dump` work-alike. However one frustration was that
    no other HTML converters I came across had the ability to deal
    affectively with HTML <TABLE>s. This module can in a rudimentary sense
    do so. The aim was to provide facility to take a simple HTML based email
    template, and to also convert it to text with the <TABLE> structure
    intact for inclusion as "multipart/alternative" content. Further, it
    will preserve both the formatting specified by the <TD> tag's "align"
    attribute, and will also preserve multiline text inside of a <TD>
    element provided it is broken using <BR/> tags.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

METHODS
  convert
EXAMPLE
    Given the HTML below ...

        <HTML><BODY>
        <TABLE>
            <TR>
                <TD ALIGN="right">Name:</TD>
                <TD>Mr. Foo Bar</TD>
            </TR>
            <TR>
                <TD ALIGN="right">Address:</TD>
                <TD>
                    #1-276 Quux Lane,     <BR/>
                    Schenectady, NY, USA, <BR/>
                    12345
                </TD>
            </TR>
            <TR>
                <TD ALIGN="right">Email:</TD>
                <TD><a href="mailto:foo@bar.baz">foo@bar.baz</a></TD>
            </TR>
        </TABLE>
        </BODY></HTML>

    ... the (default) return value of convert() will be as follows.

           Name:  Mr. Foo Bar

        Address:  #1-276 Quux Lane,
                  Schenectady, NY, USA,
                  12345

          Email:  [1]foo@bar.baz



                  1. mailto:foo@bar.baz

CAVEATS
        * This does not handle <TH> elements whatsoever!

        * It assumes a fixed width font for display of resulting text.

        * It doesn't work well on nested <TABLE>s or other nested blocks within <TABLE>s.
